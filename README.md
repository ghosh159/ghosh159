## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Akshat**, a **Robotics Master's student** at the **University of Minnesota** with a CS background, focusing on **AI/ML research**.

```python
def current_focus():
    return ["privacy-preserving ML", "computer vision", "autonomous systems"]
```

## About Me
* ðŸŽ“ **Academic Background**: Taken every AI/ML course my university offersâ€”neural networks, computer vision, reinforcement learning, NLP, and more
* ðŸ”¬ **Research Experience**: 4+ years working on **NIH/NASA-funded projects**, building intelligent systems for real-world applications
* ðŸ¤– **Current Work**: Developing privacy-preserving machine learning frameworks and autonomous navigation systems

## Technical Focus
* **Machine Learning**: Neural Networks, Computer Vision, Privacy-Preserving ML, Deep Learning
* **Robotics**: Autonomous Navigation, Sensor Fusion, Real-time Control Systems
* **Programming**: Python, Java, C++, MATLAB
* **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, MediaPipe, OpenCV, ROS

## Current Projects
* **Gopher MPC Framework** - Privacy-preserving ML for sensitive data using multi-party computation
* **ASL Recognition System** - Deep learning pipeline achieving 96% accuracy with MediaPipe
* **Autonomous Navigation** - Computer vision + sensor fusion for intelligent robot control

## Research Interests
Building practical AI systems that solve real problemsâ€”whether that's preserving privacy in ML, enabling better human-computer interaction, or creating more intelligent autonomous systems.

Always interested in collaborating on interesting AI/ML projects. Feel free to reach out!
